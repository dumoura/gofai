# Exploring Symbolic AI and Reinforcement Learning

Let’s delve into the two fundamental AI approaches, symbolic AI and reinforcement learning, \
to illustrate these concepts and discuss how they can be combined.

📚 Exciting times in our AI Foundations class at Unicamp-FCA! 

This week we're diving deep into both classical and modern AI approaches through hands-on coding exercises. I've just uploaded some new Jupyter notebooks to help my students understand the fascinating evolution of artificial intelligence:

🤖 GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned AI) Notebook: Exploring the foundations of symbolic AI and logical reasoning - the approach that dominated AI's early days

🎮 Reinforcement Learning with A3C: Using the classic Kung Fu game to demonstrate how modern AI learns through interaction and reward systems

🗺️ Symbolic Maze Solver: A practical example combining traditional rule-based systems with modern approaches

These materials showcase how different AI paradigms evolved and complement each other. It's fascinating to see students grasp these concepts through practical examples!
